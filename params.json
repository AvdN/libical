It is currently maintained by Art Cancro\r\nand Wilfried Goesgens.\r\n\r\nLibical is an Open Source implementation of the iCalendar protocols\r\nand protocol data units. The iCalendar specification describes how\r\ncalendar clients can communicate with calendar servers so users can\r\nstore their calendar data and arrange meetings with other users. \r\n\r\nLibical implements RFC2445, RFC2446 and some of RFC2447.\r\n\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n========\r\nThe code and datafiles in this distribution are licensed under the\r\nMozilla Public License (MPL) v1.0.
